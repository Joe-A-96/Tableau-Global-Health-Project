# Tableau-Global-Health-Project

## 🌍 Global Health Trends and Comparative Analysis (Tableau)

**An interactive data visualization dashboard built in Tableau to explore, analyze, and compare key public health indicators and trends across various countries and regions worldwide.**

***

## 💡 Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to transform complex global health statistics into an accessible and dynamic visual tool. The dashboard facilitates the analysis of critical health issues by focusing on:

1.  **Geographical Disparities:** Identifying differences in health metrics (e.g., mortality, disease rates) across countries using interactive maps.
2.  **Trend Analysis:** Tracking changes in key indicators (e.g., life expectancy, immunization rates) over time.
3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Enabling users to compare the performance of multiple countries or regions side-by-side.

## 🛠️ Key Tableau Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases expertise in data modeling, advanced geographic visualization, and creating a highly interactive analytical interface.

### Data Modeling & Preparation

* **Data Source Connection:** Connected and prepared public health datasets (e.g., from WHO, World Bank, or similar sources).
* **Data Joins/Relationship Modeling:** Established relationships between multiple tables (e.g., health metrics, demographics, and country metadata) for a cohesive analysis.

### Advanced Visualization & Geography

* **Geographical Mapping:** Used Tableau's mapping capabilities to visualize health indicators (e.g., via choropleth maps) at a country or sub-region level.
* **Time Series Visualizations:** Built effective line and area charts to illustrate health **trends over time**.
* **Comparative Charts:** Designed visualizations (e.g., bar charts, rank charts) for easy comparison of metrics across different entities.

### Interactivity & Dynamic Design

* **Calculated Fields:** Created custom public health metrics and rates (e.g., per capita spending, growth rates).
* **Parameters:** Implemented **Parameters** to allow the user to dynamically select which health indicator (e.g., 'Life Expectancy', 'Infant Mortality') is displayed on the map or primary chart.
* **Dashboard Actions:** Utilized **Filter Actions** to enable clicking on a country in the map to filter all other charts for that country's specific trends and details.
* **Dashboard Layout:** Structured a professional, multi-panel dashboard emphasizing clear labeling and efficient use of screen real estate.
